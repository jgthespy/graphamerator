Play with graphs!  This will be focused on Caley graphs and their monoid cousins at first but I'd like to make it useful for any kind of graphs in the future.

This is my first time using WebGL and I'm trying to do everything myself.  That includes any kind of math, so there will probably be things that have much better algorithms available but I don't want to know about them until everything is functional.  I'm also still relatively new to Javascript so it might be ugly.

Plans:
* Input adjacency graphs (maybe multiplication tables too)
* Output to TikZ
* 3D graphs
