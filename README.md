Play with graphs!  This will be focused on Caley graphs and their monoid cousins at first but I'd like to make it useful for any kind of graphs in the future.

This is my first time using WebGL and I'm trying to do everything myself.  That includes any kind of math, so there will probably be things that have much better algorithms available but I don't want to know about them until everything is functional.

It's a huge mess right now.  Don't look at it.  I'm trying to get it to be functional for my research as quickly as possible but I only have about 30 minutes a night to spend on it.  It should be cleaned up soon since it's too messy to progess at this point.

Notes: 
* (0,0) is at the center of the canvas

Short-term plans:
* Input adjacency graphs (maybe multiplication tables too)
* Output to TikZ
* 3D graphs
