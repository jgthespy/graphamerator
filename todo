CLEANUP
1. Graph object containing all graph functions.  Instance with elements array
2. Node and edge objects have their own draw functions
3. All globals go in the global object
4. No references to external variables/objects
5. No calls between files  
6. Recombine files appropriately
7. Node and edge objects are dense.  Redesign based on the new graph object


TODO
Clean up HTML interface
-Expandable boxes of related options
-Keyboard shortcut toggle
-Black on white vs. white on black
Draw arrow for directed graphs
Movable midpoint for edges to allow multiple edges
Support for edge loops
Editable colors
Editable labels
Planarize!
Have the line follow the cursor when creating edge


BUGS
Edges not removed from node's edge array on deletion
-Nodes may or may no still have an edge array after redesign
